## Description

The process of planning a really good weekly grocery list takes us forever. It's always a game of "do you remember what we need?," or "what do you want to eat this week?." We often forget things or don't eat nearly as well because we just don't feel like planning the list. One day while we were going through this process I decided to make a simple app to fix the process.

Grocree allows you to build a list of staples and a list of ingredients for recipes and generate your grocery list based on these propopulated lists. Instead of starting from scratch, you start with a list of all the things you want in your kitchen and for the meals you'd like to make and you can check off the things that you already have.

The app works equally well on desktop and mobile.

## Technologies Used

- Mongo DB
- Express
- Node JS
- HTML/CSS/Javascript

### Lists

The user generates their grocery list by deciding if they want to include the staples and which recipes they'd like to include. The app then generates the grocery list and items can be added and removed from the list.

## Next Steps

- It would be nice if you could add recipes to a list after it's been generated. We've found we'd like to keep a running list of items in the week and then add the staples and recipes.
